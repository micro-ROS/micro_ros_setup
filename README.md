# Supported platforms

This package is the **official build system for micro-ROS**. It provides tools and utils to crosscompile micro-ROS with just the common ROS 2 tools for these platforms:

| RTOS                                                                                                                | Platform                                                                                                                                                                                 | Version                      | Example                      |

# Dependencies

This package targets the **ROS 2** installation. ROS 2 supported distributions are:

| ROS 2 Distro | State     | Branch     |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Crystal      | EOL       | `crystal`  |
| Dashing      | EOL       | `dashing`  |
| Foxy         | Supported | `foxy`     |
| Galactic     | Supported | `galactic` |
| Rolling      | Supported | `main`     |

Some other prerequisites needed for building a firmware using this package are:

```
sudo apt install python3-rosdep
```
# Quick start

Download [here](https://www.eprosima.com/index.php/downloads-all) the micro-ROS docker image that contains a pre-installed client and agent as well as some compiled examples.

# Building

Create a ROS 2 workspace and build this package for a given ROS 2 distro (see table above):

```bash
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash

mkdir uros_ws && cd uros_ws

git clone -b $ROS_DISTRO https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup.git src/micro_ros_setup

rosdep update && rosdep install --from-path src --ignore-src -y

colcon build

source install/local_setup.bash
```

Once the package is built, the firmware scripts are ready to run.

You can find tutorials for moving your first steps with micro-ROS on an RTOS in the [micro-ROS webpage](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_rtos/).


## Creating micro-ROS firmware

Using the `create_firmware_ws.sh [RTOS] [Platform]` command, a firmware folder will be created with the required code for building a micro-ROS app. For example, for our reference platform, the invocation is:

```bash
# Creating a NuttX + micro-ROS firmware workspace
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh nuttx olimex-stm32-e407

# Creating a FreeRTOS + micro-ROS firmware workspace
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh freertos olimex-stm32-e407

# Creating a Zephyr + micro-ROS firmware workspace
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh zephyr olimex-stm32-e407
```

## Configuring micro-ROS firmware

By running `configure_firmware.sh` command the installed firmware is configured and modified in a pre-build step. This command will show its usage if parameters are not provided:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh [configuration] [options]
```

By running this command without any argument the available demo applications and configurations will be shown.

Common options available at this configuration step are:
  - `--transport` or `-t`: `udp`, `serial` or any hardware specific transport label
  - `--dev` or `-d`: agent string descriptor in a serial-like transport (optional)
  - `--ip` or `-i`: agent IP in a network-like transport (optional)
  - `--port` or `-p`: agent port in a network-like transport (optional)


Please note that each RTOS has its configuration approach that you might use for further customization of these base configurations. Visit the [micro-ROS webpage](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_rtos/) for detailed information about RTOS configuration.

In summary, the supported configurations for transports are:

|                               |       NuttX        |     FreeRTOS      |       Zephyr       |

*<sup>1</sup> Community supported, may have lack of official support*

## Building micro-ROS firmware

By running `build_firmware.sh` the firmware is built:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh
```

## Flashing micro-ROS firmware

In order to flash the target platform run `flash_firmware.sh` command.
This step may need some platform-specific procedure to boot the platform in flashing mode:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup flash_firmware.sh
```

# Building micro-ROS-Agent

Using this package is possible to install a ready to use **micro-ROS-Agent**:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_agent_ws.sh
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_agent.sh
source install/local_setup.sh
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent [parameters]
```

# Contributing

As it is explained along this document, the firmware building system takes **four steps**: creating, configuring, building and flashing.

New combinations of platforms and RTOS are intended to be included in `config` folder. For example, the scripts for building a **micro-ROS** app for **Crazyflie 2.1** using **FreeRTOS** is located in `config/freertos/crazyflie21`.

This folder contains up to four scripts:
- `create.sh`: gets a variable named `$FW_TARGETDIR` and installs in this path all the dependencies and code required for the firmware.
- `configure.sh`: modifies and configure parameters of the installed dependencies. This step is **optional**.
- `build.sh`: builds the firmware and create a platform-specific linked binary.
- `flash.sh`: flashes the binary in the target platform.

Some other required files inside the folder can be accessed from these scripts using the following paths:

```bash
# Files inside platform folder
$PREFIX/config/$RTOS/$PLATFORM/

# Files inside config folder
$PREFIX/config
```
