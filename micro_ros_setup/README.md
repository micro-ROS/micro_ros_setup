# Supported platforms

| RTOS | Platform | Example |
|-|-|-|
| [Nuttx](https://nuttx.org/) | Olimex STM32-E407, STM32F4Discovery | `nuttx olimex-stm32-e407` | 
| [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) | [Crazyflie 2.1](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2-1/) | `freertos crazyflie21` | 
| [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) | [Olimex STM32-E407](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/open-source-hardware) | `freertos olimex_e407` | 
| Linux / Windows | *Host* * |

Please note that NuttX with Olimex STM32-E407 board is the reference platform and not everything might be supported on other platforms.

*\* Support for compiling apps in a native host for testing and debugging*

**\* Configuration for different platforms through configure_firmware.sh*

# Dependencies

This package targets **ROS 2** installation. ROS 2 supported distributions are:

| ROS 2 Distro | State | Branch |
|-|-|-|
| Crystal | Supported | `crystal` |
| Dashing | Supported | `dashing` |
| Eloquent | *Work in progress* |  |

Some other prerequisites needed for building a firmware using this package are:

```
sudo apt install python-rosdep
```

# Building 

Create a ROS 2 workspace and build this package for a given ROS 2 distro (see table above):

```bash
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash

mkdir uros_ws && cd uros_ws

git clone -b $ROS_DISTRO https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ros-build.git src/micro-ros-build

rosdep update && rosdep install --from-path src --ignore-src -y

colcon build

source install/local_setup.bash
```

Once the package is built, the firmware scripts are ready to run.


## Creating micro-ROS firmware

Using `create_firmware_ws.sh [RTOS] [Platform]` command a firmware folder will be created with the required code for building a micro-ROS app. For example, for our reference platform, the invocation is:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh nuttx olimex-stm32-e407
```

If you are instead targeting FreeRTOS, you would use:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh freertos olimex-stm32-e407
```


## Configuring micro-ROS firmware

By running `configure_firmware.sh` command the installed firmware is configured and modified in a pre-build step. Usually this command will show its usage if parameters are required:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh [configuration]
```

For NuttX, several different configurations are supported.

| NuttX Configuration | Features |
|-|-|
| uros |  Micro-ROS publisher & subscriber, Kobuki demo |
| drive_base | Kobuki demo |
| pingpong | Round-Trip-Time test over serial |
| pingpong-eth | Round-Trip-Time test over Ethernet |

Please note that these are only default configurations. Each RTOS has its configuration approach that you might use for further customization of these base configurations.

## Building micro-ROS firmware

By running `build_firmware.sh` the firmware is built:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh
```

## Flashing micro-ROS firmware

In order to flash the target platform run `flash_firmware.sh` command. This step may need some platform-specific procedure in order to boot the platform in flashing node:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup flash_firmware.sh
```

# Building micro-ROS Agent

Using this package is possible to install a ready to use **micro-ROS Agent**:

```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_agent_ws.sh
colcon build --meta src
source install/local_setup.sh
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent [parameters]
```

# Contributing

As it is explained along this document, the firmware building system takes **four steps**: creating, configuring, building and flashing.

New combinations of platforms and RTOS are intended to be included in `config` folder. For example, the scripts for building a **micro-ROS** app for **Crazyflie 2.1** using **FreeRTOS** is located in `config/freertos/crazyflie21`.

This folder contains up to four scripts:
- `create.sh`: gets a variable named `$FW_TARGETDIR` and installs in this path all the dependencies and code required for the firmware.
- `configure.sh`: modifies and configure parameters of the installed dependencies. This step is **optional**.
- `build.sh`: builds the firmware and create a platform-specific linked binary.
- `flash.sh`: flash the binary in the target platform.
  
Some other required files inside the folder can be accessed from these scripts using the following paths:

```bash
# Files inside platform folder
$PREFIX/config/$RTOS/$PLATFORM/

# Files inside config folder
$PREFIX/config
```
